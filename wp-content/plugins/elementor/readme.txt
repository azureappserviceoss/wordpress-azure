== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB4U67tiQLA

Introducing a WordPress website builder, with no limits of design. A website builder that delivers high-end page designs and advanced capabilities, never before seen on WordPress.

It's time for **[Elementor Website Builder](https://elementor.com/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme)**.

= The Leading Website & Page Builder =
Whether you’re a web designer looking for a way to achieve pixel-perfect websites, a marketer looking to get online fast or a developer who wants to expand their capabilities, Elementor’s website builder has what you need - intuitive drag-and-drop Editor, advanced design features and a full open-source approach.

= Faster. Much Faster. =
Instant reaction was a key feature we wanted to achieve. And we did. Instant drag & drop website builder, instant live edit, instant page load. This makes the interface fun and easy to work with, as well as reduces the time it takes to design.

= Live design. Truly Live. =
Never again work on the backend and guess what the frontend will look like. With Elementor, you’re editing the site live, and simultaneously see exactly how it looks like. Elementor features live design & inline editing, so the whole process of writing and designing is done directly on the page, with no need to press update or go to preview mode. It also works perfectly with or without Gutenberg.

= Professional Features Right Out of the Box =
With Elementor’s unique features, you can create websites that have that certain ‘designer touch’. Among our design features are: Box Shadows, Background Overlays, Hover Effects, Headline Effects, Animations, Shape Dividers, Gradient Backgrounds and much more.

= 100s of Pre-Designed Templates & Blocks =
Choose from 100+ of beautiful full page [WordPress templates](https://library.elementor.com/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) and customize them to make them your own. You can also build your website by choosing and combining from over 300+ Blocks.

Blocks are pre-designed section templates that can be easily combined into any page. Blocks include a variety of categories: services, testimonials, call to action and more. Save and reuse Elementor templates on different pages, or export them to a different website with a click.

= Responsive Live Editing =
Elementor Website  Builder comes with an exclusive toolset, that lets you create a truly responsive website in a whole new and visual way. From different font size, padding and margin per device, to reverse column ordering, this is the most powerful mobile site builder for creating perfect responsive websites.

= 40+ free widgets and counting =
No other page builder or website builder can compare to Elementor. We packed 40+ of the most useful widgets into our website builder. True, that’s way more than we had to offer, but we wanted to spare no widget from you, so you can reach the top of your design capabilities.
